# ArtPatio Security Implementation

## Overview

ArtPatio is a digital art gallery platform that allows artists to upload their artworks, customers to purchase them, and gallery owners to manage events. This document outlines the security features implemented to protect the platform against various threats and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user data.

## Security Features

The following security features have been implemented in ArtPatio:

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Protects against SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by validating and sanitizing user inputs.

2. **Password Strength Validation and Hashing**: Enforces a strong password policy and uses bcrypt for hashing passwords before storing them.

3. **Account Lockout Mechanism**: Limits the number of failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks by locking accounts after several failed attempts.

4. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Utilizes parameterized queries and stored procedures to secure database interactions.

5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restricts access to sensitive functionalities based on user roles (Artist, Customer, Gallery Owner, Admin).

6. **File Upload Security**: Ensures secure file uploads through MIME type validation and unique naming conventions for files.

7. **Session Security and Management**: Implements session management practices, including session ID regeneration and inactivity timeouts.

8. **Encryption and Decryption for Stored Data**: Uses AES encryption for sensitive data like personal information and payment details.

9. **Audit Logging**: Records critical actions for monitoring and detecting suspicious activity on the platform.

10. **Error Logging**: Logs errors securely without exposing sensitive information to potential attackers.

## Implementation Methodology

The security implementation followed a systematic approach based on best practices and the Breach Quadrilateral model. Key steps included:

- Validating and sanitizing user inputs using regular expressions and input filters.
- Enforcing strong password policies and using bcrypt for hashing.
- Implementing account lockout mechanisms and secure file upload procedures.
- Applying role-based access control to restrict user access to authorized functionalities.
- Regularly monitoring logs for suspicious activity and ensuring no sensitive information is exposed.

## Results

The implementation of these security features has led to:

- Successful mitigation of SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
- Strengthened password security with no compromised hashes.
- Improved account protection with no successful account takeovers.
- Secure file uploads with no malicious files accepted.
- Robust access control preventing unauthorized access to sensitive areas.
- Enhanced session security preventing session hijacking and fixation attacks.
- Data confidentiality through effective encryption methods.
- Comprehensive audit logging for accountability and early breach detection.
- Secure error logging preventing the exposure of sensitive information.
